## Transcript

Hello and welcome to the Album Art Podcast. This is "Episode 0: An Introduction".

Today I'd like to just tell you a little bit about myself, a little bit about this podcast, and what my ideas and goals are for the show.

So, first, myself. My name's Isaac Halvorson. I live in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I would say my biggest hobbies are finding new music, and sharing that music with others. I get excited when I encounter new music. I get excited when I hear something unique, something special, and I love sharing that experience with other people.

So each episode will be about a specific album, but I don't want it to be a review of that album. I want this to be a sort of primer, and introduction to that album. It's hard to want to listen to something if someone just tells you, "This is a great album. You should listen to it." I want to give you a little more context about the artist, a little more context about the album, and point out specific things for you to listen to on that album while you're listening through it. Because I think that will provide a more compelling reason for you to explore a certain type of music.

Taste is a really interesting thing to me. The way that a person's taste in music — or taste in anything — can change over time. It's hard to lock exactly what changes, or how things change. Each person has a very unique preference for the music they listen to, and that's one thing I want to stress on this show. I'm going to present some music, some that might be challenging to you, some that you might not like, and just know that that is OK. There's nothing wrong with that.

I also really hope that the show creates a conversation of sorts. You can follow the show's Twitter account, [@_albumart](http://twitter.com/_albumart), and I'm always open to receiving your emails about the show or about the music I present. My email address is [isaac@albumart.net](mailto=isaac@albumart.net).

So in each episode, in your podcasting app, you should be able to see the show notes, and that will contain links to all the research that I've found. Or you can always go to [albumart.net](http://albumart.net), and find that specific episode, and all the notes and links will be there as well. I'll also provide links for you to stream the album that I presented, either through Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play; I'll provide as many sources of listening to that album as possible.

So, thank you for listening to Episode 0. I really really look forward to recording these episodes and sharing them with you. And I look forward to hearing from you about what you think.

Our theme song is by [Eskimo Spy](https://soundcloud.com/eskimospy).

Again, I'm Isaac Halvorson. I'll see you next time.
