# Acetone - Acetone — Script

\[ open with *All You Know* in background ]

Hello, and welcome to this, the first episode of the Album Art podcast! I’m your host Isaac Halvorson, and today we’re going to be talking about a band called Acetone and their third album, Acetone.

The story of the band starts in 1992 in Los Angeles, CA when the three core members of the band Spinout decided to start their own band. The group consisted of three people, Richie Lee on lead vocals and bass guitar, Mark Lightcap on backing vocals and guitar, and Steve Hadley on backing vocals and drums.

Acetone released two EPs and four LPs in their career spanning from 1992–2001. The group disbanded in 2001 after the tragic suicide of Richie Lee.

After Acetone disbanded, Mark Lightcap has shifted his focus toward more electronic styles of music, working with Matmos, and also playing guitar on a dub record with the band Natural Numbers.

The band toured extensively with The Verve, but despite the multiple high profile shows, their music failed to resonate with the general public. During an interview in 2011, Richard Ashcroft was asked "Who's the best kept secret in music?" He had this to say:

> I'd like to talk about a band who actually aren't necessarily on the brink of big things because they're no more, but they're one of the unloved bands of the 90s. They were loved by the people who heard about them, but unfortunately they didn't break through — a band… an amazing band called Acetone. They were from LA, and we were fortunate to do a few tours with them back in the 90s. Through circumstances and timing, they didn't get the recognition they deserved, but I truly recommend that people go back to Acetone — or Ace-tone however you want to pronounce it — and check out their back catalog because they're one of the great… one of the biggest misses as a band in the history of music as far as I'm concerned. I think the first record's magnificent.

This self-titled album being their third, the band’s sound had changed a lot between that and their first record. Their first LP Cindy — released in 1993 — had a more rock and roll sound, which they very quickly and permanently abandoned.

Their next release — 1995’s I Guess I Would — was 7 tracks of covers of mainly country music. This was an announcement of sorts of where the band was headed. All subsequent releases had the same sort of slow, sad mood that I’ve grown to love.

Acetone's second LP *If You Only Knew* was a fuller realization of the sounds they played with on *I Guess I Would*. A slow, quiet, muted sound that extends throughout the rest of their catalog.

Now, all of these albums are worth listening to, but today we're going to be focusing on Acetone's third album, the one they self-titled *Acetone*. Most often, bands reserve the self-titling of an album for their debut. During an MTV interview, the band had this to say about the name:

> **Mark:** The decision to make this record self-titled even though it's not our first record was uh… I dunno we just sort of felt…
> **Richie:** It was like a new beginning y'know, I mean we were like starting with a new label [Vapor Records] — the old label [Vernon Yard Recordings] had sort of like withered and died in a really sad and horrid way, and this was sort of, kind of, a little bit of a spring in our step again

During the interview, the band mentions their influences — The Velvet Underground, Neil Young, and surf music — so this move to the Vapor Records was doubly exciting for them. Vapor Records is owned and run by Neil Young.
